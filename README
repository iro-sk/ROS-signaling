Boolean network of ROS signaling pathways Yap1, Sln1 and Msn2/4 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Download the folder and run the ros_signaling.m in matlab (made in version 9.7.0.1586710 (R2019b)) with the indicated directory structure. 
You will see the model output for change of ROS input from 0 to 1.
Run the reverse_ros_signaling.m to see how the system recovers from 1 to 0 ROS.
