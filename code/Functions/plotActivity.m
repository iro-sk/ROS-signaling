%description: this function depicts and saves the activity of pathway
%components in a heatmap comparing the Steady States under different nutrient conditions (glucose|nitrogen)
%arguments:
%   1. pathway to depict (Yap1, Sln1, Msn2/4, Targets)
%   2. path to save images
%   3. nutrient conditions to display
